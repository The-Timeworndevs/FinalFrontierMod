# Space, the final frontier...

Final Frontier is an ambitious space exploration mod inspired by mods like GalactiCraft and Ad Astra, but unlike either this project aims to make each body a unique adventure with novel content.

# What's in the mod?

Final Frontier will include several planets, moons, and eventually stellar systems to explore, each one curated to be unique, detailed, and expansive, with structures and quasi-lore inspired by Minecraft's own.

Current content:

- The Moon, an airless rocky body orbiting the Overworld.
  * Numerous unique building blocks, from an equivalent to stone and deepslate, among other materials.

Planned Content:

- More content for The Moon, bosses, structures, etc...
  * The Man on the Moon, an ancient illager, older than the settlements, trapped on The Moon and bitter against the world...
  * Many new mobs, from undead spacefarers to unique aliens, like the Mimic, a shulker-like creature that mimics certain blocks.
  * Many structures, from lunar villages, illager facilities, and an analog to the Trial Chanbers: The Lunar Vault.
- Mars, a dry, rusty, rocky wasteland with scattered patches of water and carbon dioxide ices.
  * Dust storms, Mars' analog for rain and thunder on the Overworld.
  * Buried structures hinting at an ancient, long dead civilization that walked mars so long ago...
- Venus, a wasteland crushed by a hot, dense atmosphere, veiled by thick, noxious clouds.
  * Acid rain and thunderstorms, occuring when the Overworld recieves precipitation.
  * Many abandoned outposts, with evidence of some mass-evacuation, the few that stayed around have either devolved into hermits, or have been taken over by a mysterious organism...
  * New monsters with a mildly gigeresque inspiration, from scientists taken over by some parasite, alien creatures that shy from the light, and many other horrors...
- Mercury, a rocky world baking under The Sun, blasted with solar flares that occasionally manifest as plasma-based blaze analogs.
  * Flare, a powerful fuel found on Mercury, dropped by plasma monsters, and a boss called "The Nova".
  * Tungsten, a heavy, heat-resistant metal, perfect for heat shields and cuboid objects!
  * Solar Storms, events on Mercury that occur when it is raining on the Overworld, with more severe events during thunderstorms.
