# Space, the final frontier...

Final Frontier is an ambitious space exploration mod inspired by mods like GalactiCraft and Ad Astra, but unlike either this project aims to make each moon and planet a unique adventure with novel content.

# What's in the mod?

Final Frontier will include several planets, moons, and eventually stellar systems to explore, each one curated to be unique, detailed, and expansive, with structures and quasilore inspired by Minecraft's own.

Current content:

- The Moon, an airless rocky body orbiting the Overworld.
  * Numerous unique building blocks, from an equivalent to stone and deepslate, among other materials.

Planned Content:

- More content for The Moon, bosses, structures, etc...
- Mars, a dry, rusty, rocky wasteland with scattered patches of water and carbon dioxide ices.
- Venus, a wasteland crushed by a hot, dense atmosphere, veiled by thick, noxious clouds.
- Mercury, a rocky world baking under The Sun, blasted with solar flares that occasionally manifest as plasma-based blaze analogs.
